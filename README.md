## What is this?
Most everyday things that I want are available as pretty nice programs.

I want the news? RSS
I want reddit? RTV
I want reddit but chat? IRC
...etc...


Most everyday things that are a little more niche can be done by scripts, bound to a hotkey, but sometimes I don't really want something bound to a hotkey.

Like I want to see the weather, that's so insignificant that I don't want it as a hotkey, but I still want it.

1. Just start making stuff, any kind of command, any kind of useful thing that I should know.
2. Once stuff is being made, work with parsing them the best way possible using my own behavior. (pitfall: I might just give up and call the methods the way I want to. I might just end up using this like I use the shell, while the idea is that it's supposed to be at least somewhat natural language.)
