# This is my lowkey-jarvis thing (name TBD)

## Course of action
1. Just start making stuff, any kind of command, any kind of useful thing that I should know.
2. Once stuff is being made, work with parsing them the best way possible using my own behavior. (pitfall: I might just give up and call the methods the way I want to. I might just end up using this like I use the shell, while the idea is that it's supposed to be at least somewhat natural language.)
