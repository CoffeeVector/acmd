## What is this?
This is a conglomeration of things that were going to be scripts, but doesn't-feel-right/doesn't-deserve to be put as a shell script.
For example, there's a auto-googling command in here. It would be awfully strange to have a shell script called google (also because it happens to be taken) which takes in a natural language sentence as an argument.

tl;dr: anything useful, worth it to implement, not worth it to take up a hotkey. This thing operates in that little grey area.

## Does this project seem way too specific and without much direction?
Yes.

## Why am I doing this?
I don't know, cause it might be cool?
