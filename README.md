## What is this?
This is a conglomeration of things that were going to be scripts, but that I put together.
For example, the art of googling. It's something that I need on a practically daily basis, but I don't like the fact that I have to type what I want and then scroll through everything when what I want is probably in the first 5 links
Instead, I want a script that can do this, but I don't really want to dedicate this to a script bound to a hotkey.

tl;dr: anything useful, worth it to implement, not worth it to take up a hotkey. Yeah, this program operates in that little grey area.

## Does this project seem way too specific and without much direction?
Yes.

## Why am I doing this?
I don't know, cause it might be cool?
